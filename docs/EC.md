Edward Cao is an Associate Professor of Electrical & Computer Engineering at Queen’s University, Canada. His research centers on developing advanced mathematical and computational frameworks to model stochastic gene expression dynamics with precision, interpretability, and real-world applicability.

Edward Cao employs generating-function theory, deep learning, and stochastic process analysis to address complex questions in systems and synthetic biology. His theoretical models—ranging from non-Markov transcription–translation kinetics to neural-network-accelerated solvers—act as interpretable tools for mechanism discrimination and parameter inference, and are applied in close collaboration with experimental teams working on single‐cell genomics around the world.

He used to be a Ph.D. student of Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering at Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (HKUST) while being under the supervision of Professor Furong Gao, and obtained the Chan & Wong Best Postgraduate Award of the department upon graduation. Thereafter, he got fascinated by systems biology and started to attempt to decipher transcriptional mechanisms quantitatively, while he was working as postdoctoral fellow both at Harvard University and the University of Edinburgh. Given the high-profile results achieved during the period, he received a prestigious award -- the 1000 Talent Plan of China with a start-up fund of RMB 3,000,000, and was also promoted to full professor thereafter at ECUST.

Broadly, his research interests pertain to making use of machine learning to gain quantitative understanding of biochemical systems, and gene expression in particular. Gene expression is akin to ``brain" in cells, as it intricately coordinates almost all the intracellular processes. The novel discovery of underlying mechanisms leads to new insights for cancer therapeutics, medicine and vaccine development, etc. By resolving the technical challenges of scarce and noisy data as well as large scale of reactions, he have developed a series of intelligent modeling methods for gaining a quantitative panorama of gene expression regulatory mechanisms in high-throughput and high-resolution. These interesting results were summarized into 32 peer-reviewed papers, of which 2 papers in Nature Communications and 1 paper in PNAS are all either first-authored or corresponding authored by me in recent 3 years. One of the paper was awarded 2021 World Artificial Intelligence Conference Youth Outstanding Paper Nomination Award, 2021 Shanghai Association of Artificial Intelligence Youth Best Paper Award, 2021 National Natural Science Foundation of China Outstanding Project Award (50 out of 50,000 projects across all subjects and all grant types nationally), and was also widely covered by mainstream media in China such as Xuexi Qiangguo, Xinmin Evening News, Wenhui Bao, ScienceNet. Besides, he serve as an Editorial Board member of the journals -- The Innovation (expected IF > 20) and IEEE/CAA Journal of Automatica Sinica (IF=6.171). Notably, he was awarded 2021 MIT Technology Review Innovators Under 35 Asia Pacific. For details, please refer to his CV and research statement attached.
