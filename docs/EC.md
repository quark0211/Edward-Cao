Edward Cao is an Associate Professor of Electrical & Computer Engineering at Queen’s University, Canada. His research centers on developing advanced mathematical and computational frameworks to model stochastic gene expression dynamics with precision, interpretability, and real-world applicability.

Edward Cao employs generating-function theory, deep learning, and stochastic process analysis to address complex questions in systems and synthetic biology. His theoretical models—ranging from non-Markov transcription–translation kinetics to neural-network-accelerated solvers—act as interpretable tools for mechanism discrimination and parameter inference, and are applied in close collaboration with experimental teams working on single‐cell genomics around the world.
